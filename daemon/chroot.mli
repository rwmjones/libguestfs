(** This is a generic module for running functions in a chroot.
    The function runs in a forked subprocess too so that we can
    restore the root afterwards.

    It handles passing the parmeter, forking, running the
    function and marshalling the result or any exceptions. *)

val create : ?name:string -> string -> t
(** Create a chroot handle.  [?name] is an optional name used in
    debugging and error messages.  The string is the chroot
    directory. *)

val f : t -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b
(** Run a function in the chroot, returning the result or re-raising
    any exception thrown. *)
